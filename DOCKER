Docker is a popular open-source platform that acts as a container engine,
enabling developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment.
(A container engine is the software that manages and runs containers, providing the necessary runtime environment)

Docker makes it easy to build and run distributed microservices architecures, deploy your code with standardized continuous integration and delivery pipelines, build highly-scalable data processing systems, and create fully-managed platforms for your developers.
