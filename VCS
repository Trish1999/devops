VCS--->version controll system
VCS is a software tool that tracks changes to files over time. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, revert to earlier versions, and experiment with new features.

type of version controll system
1.Centralized version control systems (CVCS)
Store all file versions on a single server. Developers can borrow files, make changes, and return them to the server.
example---->svn(subversion) and CVS(Concurrent Versions System)
Drawbacks of CVCS:
1. internet connection all the time.
2. multiple developers cann't work on same file simultaneously

2.Distributed version control systems (DVCS)
Allow each developer to have their own local copy of the project's codebase. This allows developers to work offline and experiment with new features.
In DVCS there is also a master branch or central version.
example--->git and mericurial

Benefits
Collaboration: Developers can work together on projects. 
Reverting changes: Developers can return to earlier versions of a file. 
Experimentation: Developers can try out new features without affecting the main codebase.
